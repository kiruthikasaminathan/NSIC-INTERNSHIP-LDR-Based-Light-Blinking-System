# NSIC-INTERNSHIP-LDR-Based-Light-Blinking-System
Project Description:
Developed a light blinking system using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) circuit simulated in Proteus. The system was designed to turn an LED on or off based on the ambient light levels detected by the LDR, demonstrating both analog and digital control capabilities.

Key Features:
Light Detection: Utilizes an LDR that changes its resistance according to the ambient light levels.
LED Control: When the light level drops below a certain threshold, the system triggers the LED to blink.
User-defined Sensitivity: Allows the user to adjust the sensitivity level of the LDR, which can be done by modifying a potentiometer in the circuit.
Simulation in Proteus: Simulated the circuit using Proteus to validate design and functionality before hardware implementation.
Technologies Used:
Embedded Systems: Simulated using Proteus
Microcontroller: Arduino (or any other suitable microcontroller)
Programming Language: C/C++ for Arduino IDE
Components: LDR, LED, resistors, Arduino, potentiometer
Circuit Design:

Simulation:

Simulated the entire circuit in Proteus and tested different ambient light levels to evaluate the responsiveness of the LED blinking function.
Made necessary adjustments to the code and circuit based on simulated behavior.
Testing and Iteration:

Conducted multiple tests to ensure that the LED blinks accurately in response to changes in light levels.
Refined the code for efficiency and responsiveness.
- Technologies: Arduino, Proteus, C++
